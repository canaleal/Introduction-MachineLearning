<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>


Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that uses algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn and improve from experience. It has become a vital tool in a variety of applications, from self-driving cars and voice recognition systems to fraud detection and personalized marketing. If you are interested in getting started with machine learning, this README is here to provide you with a quick overview of some commonly asked questions and useful resources. Note, I will be creating basic code templates and commiting them to this repo.

<h1 id="advice">Advice</h1>

If you're interested in getting into machine learning, don't be intimidated by the idea that you need a Master's degree in math. Many machine learning engineers and data scientists have successfully transitioned from software engineering positions with only a basic understanding of math, such as linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. Of course, there may be situations where you'll need to study higher-level math to implement a specific paper, but that's something you can tackle as needed.

My advice would be to brush up on your high school math and some undergraduate-level math, specifically eigen vectors and probability and statistics. Since you're already proficient at coding (Probably), you can start going through the documentation of popular machine learning frameworks like pyTorch or TensorFlow as needed. Personally, I recommend starting with Keras because it's easy and allows you to focus on the underlying logic without getting bogged down in coding details. Once you feel confident enough to visualize what's happening naturally (similar to how you instinctively write code in an object-oriented programming format), then you can move on to more advanced frameworks like pyTorch or TensorFlow.


## Finding a Niche/ Interest

When it comes to getting started with machine learning, it's important to find a niche that interests you. (Mine is computer vision cause it's fun and looks super cool) Maybe you're fascinated by image recognition, or you're interested in using machine learning to help with fraud detection. Whatever your niche, find a tutorial that can guide you through the basics. There are plenty of tutorials available online for free, so you don't need to spend a lot of money to get started. Once you've completed a tutorial, challenge yourself by choosing a simple project to work on. This could be anything from building a chatbot to predicting stock prices. Don't worry if your project seems basic at first – the goal is to get your feet wet and start building your skills.

As you work on your project, take advantage of resources like GitHub to find repositories that solve similar problems. This can help you learn new techniques and get inspiration for how to approach your own project. And whenever you encounter a new concept or term that you're not familiar with, don't be afraid to google it and take your time to learn and understand it fully. Remember, learning machine learning is a journey, and it's okay to take your time and make mistakes along the way. As you continue to follow tutorials, work on projects, and expand your knowledge, you'll gain more confidence and be able to take on increasingly complex challenges.

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

## What skills do I need to learn machine learning?

To learn machine learning, you will need a strong foundation in programming, math (linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics), and data analysis. Some knowledge of algorithms and data structures will also be helpful.

## What programming languages are commonly used in machine learning?

Python is the most commonly used programming language for machine learning, followed by R. There are also some libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn that make it easier to work with machine learning algorithms in these languages.

## What are some important machine learning algorithms to learn?

Some important machine learning algorithms to learn include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks.

## What are some challenges in machine learning?

Some common challenges in machine learning include overfitting, underfitting, data quality, bias, interpretability, privacy, security, and scalability.

## What are some job opportunities in machine learning?

There are many job opportunities in machine learning, including machine learning engineer, data scientist, research scientist, software engineer, and data analyst. Many industries are investing in machine learning, so there are opportunities in healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and other areas. In Canada, the average machine learning developer makes around $98,000 per year as shown on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salaries/machine-learning-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,25.htm)

## How long does it take to learn machine learning?

The time it takes to learn machine learning depends on your background knowledge and how much time you can devote to learning. Some people can learn the basics in a few weeks, while others may take several months to become proficient. It's important to be patient and persistent, and to keep practicing and applying what you learn.
